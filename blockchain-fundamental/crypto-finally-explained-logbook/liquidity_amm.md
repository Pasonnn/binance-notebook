## Liquidity Pool
- Liquidity pool let you trade immediately (dont need to wait people to trade with you).

## AMM
- AMM is stand for Automated Market Maker
- AMM algorithm (basic): Coin_X * Coin_Y = Z
    - For example, if the Liquidity Pool have 1000 coinx, 1000 coiny so the z will be 1.000.000. If you trade 200 coin x for coin y, you will get 167 coin y instead of 200
- Liquidity Providers will invest their coin and get a small amount of fee from traders that interact with the pool
- The AMM algorithm get really complex, and have more than 2 assets inside it at the time.
