# üåê DeFi 2.0

## 1. Definitions

* **DeFi** stands for **Decentralized Finance**.
* It uses **smart contracts** (self-executing code on the blockchain) to run financial applications like trading, lending, or staking ‚Äî without human control or intermediaries.
* **DeFi 2.0** is the next generation of DeFi protocols, designed to **solve the core issues of DeFi 1.0** such as unsustainable liquidity mining and reliance on external liquidity providers.

## 2. Core Idea of DeFi 2.0

* In DeFi 1.0, protocols often ‚Äúrented‚Äù liquidity by giving out token rewards. This attracted short-term capital that disappeared when rewards ended.
* DeFi 2.0 introduces mechanisms to make liquidity **protocol-owned and sustainable**, instead of relying on mercenary farmers.
* This shift is made possible entirely by **smart contracts** ‚Äî ensuring automation, transparency, and minimizing human error or manipulation.

## 3. Example: OlympusDAO (Pioneer of DeFi 2.0)

OlympusDAO introduced a new model of liquidity management that became the foundation of DeFi 2.0:

* **Bonding**: The protocol sells its native token (OHM) at a **discount** to users who provide assets like DAI or **liquidity pool (LP) tokens**.
* **Protocol-Controlled Liquidity (POL)**: Instead of users owning the liquidity and withdrawing it anytime, the **protocol itself owns the liquidity**.

  * This means liquidity is permanent, sticky, and the protocol earns trading fees.
  * The treasury grows over time, creating a more sustainable foundation for the ecosystem.

‚úÖ **In short:**

* DeFi = decentralized finance powered by smart contracts.
* DeFi 2.0 = next phase, solving liquidity and sustainability issues of DeFi 1.0.
* OlympusDAO pioneered this with **bonding** and **protocol-owned liquidity (POL)**, changing how liquidity is managed.
